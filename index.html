      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there, and thank you for stopping by! This is my first website, where I hope to showcase my projects. I want to start by saying that I am not a professional coder or programmerâ€”this is purely a personal project for my development and enjoyment. It's not a commercial venture, just a space for me to learn and share my journey.</p>
      <p>There isn't much to show at the moment, but if you'd like to share your thoughts or offer some guidance, feel free to visit <a href="https://github.com/Project-JoBo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my GitHub</a>. I'm sure it won't be long before you start seeing more projects take shape!</p>

      <h1>March 2025</h1>
      <p>I'm currently working through a Full-Stack Engineering course with Codecademy. To help me better absorb the information, I decided to put what I'm learning into practice by building a website alongside the course.</p>
